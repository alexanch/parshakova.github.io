My primary research objective is to develop novel learning algorithms using techniques from optimization and statistics, to bring theoretical guarantees about the convergence of iterative methods and the quality of the produced solutions, and to obtain the control models in the approximate dynamical system environments.

I am now research engineering intern at Naver Labs Europe and am lucky to collaborate with
<a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=bTXN9_0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Dr. Marc Dymetman</a>.

<br />
Previously, I received a Bachelors in the <a href="http://id.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?document_srl=21142&mid=rnews" target="_blank">Department of Industrial Design</a> (College of Information Science and Technology) at KAIST with the concentration in Human Computer Interaction, where I worked on several research projects with [Prof. Daniel Saakes](http://mid.kaist.ac.kr/people/). Then, I obtained Master's degree at  <a href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/?language=en" target="_blank">KAIST School of Electrical Engineering</a>. I was a member of <a href="http://brain.kaist.ac.kr/about_us.html" target="_blank">Brain Reverse Engineering and Imaging Laboratory</a>, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nd-UgBYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Prof. Dae-Shik Kim</a>.
